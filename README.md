# Beginner-Adventure

    ---TextAdventure is an interactive game revolving around user input. The game (in progress) will describe specific locations such as rooms, space stations, fantasy forests, etc.---
    
 * The user interacts with objects in the enviornment through text-based commands to progress to the next area. As of 11-4-17, the game progresses linearly, however in the future I would like the user to be able to pick where they would like to go. The current dialogue is only a placeholder- it is likely to be changed. 
 
 * As of 11-4-17, I'm working on implementing choices / progression / development details instead of a proper, interesting story.
 
 * Development details: The entire game exists within the main method of the TextAdventure class. The game itself is executable, and does currently (11-4-17) not implement any additional classes. The game is built so that I can practice: using boolean conditions for while loop exits, creating strong if else if statements, and communicating with the user efficiently through clear dialogue / prompts.

 * Features I would like to implemenet: Currently, the game uses boolean switches to determine whether or not the user has something. Eventually, I would like to move these booleans into a seperate class and define them in their own respective methods. (getKey, getBaskbetball, etc.). In addition I'd like to create a player object of the DefiningClass inside of the TextAdventure class. I believe this would allow the TextAdventure class to be understandably more readable. 

* Importantly: Creating a DefiningClass would allow myself / others to use DefiningClass to create many TextAdventure classes using similar methods that involve common TextAdventure tropes (lookAround, getObject, openDoor, moveNorth).

 * Why: Fun! I guess?

* Version Reference:
* v1.0 (11-3-17)
* v1.1 (11-4-17)
* v1.2 (11-5-17)

* (11-5-17) I uploaded the .jar && .bat files. In order to run the program on your own machine, download both of these files and place them within the same directory. Then, double click the batch file to execute.
